# Kinos-Seal-Life
A small script I threw together to spawn dolphins near the beach by Luna park


You can use this as a template to spawn other aquatic animals into your city, or peds. Simply replace the hash model with the model you're looking to use, change the vector to it's proper position, and add the appropriate tasks you'd like for them to do.

You can find the natives for wandering here https://docs.fivem.net/natives/?_0xBB9CE077274F6A1B
